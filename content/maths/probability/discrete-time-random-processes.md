# Random processes

A random process $X(t)$ is a function $x(t)$ defined over some time domain $t \in T$ that is drawn according to a probability distribution over all values of $x(t) \in X$.

Also known as stochastic processes. 

For discrete-time, this is pretty straightforward, and just simplifiers to the probability distribution over a set of random variables $\\{ x_i \\}_{i=1}^N$.

The vast majority of the time, we only care about discre-time random processes. However, if studying real systems, this requires first discretising the continuous-time system.

Therefore, I will look at the coninuous-time case only for simple, practical examples and show how to discretise these.
