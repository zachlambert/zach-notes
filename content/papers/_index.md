## How I approach collecting research papers

My main objective with looking at research papers is to get an awareness of the different methods of tackling a problem and their advantages/disadvantages.

Therefore, for every research paper, my objective is to answer the following questions:
- What problem is the paper trying to solve?
- What is their approach?
- How does it differ to existing approaches, and how does it improve upon then?
- What are the remaining challenges?

Following this, the `papers/` section is organised as follows:
- Sections are created for broad categories of problem
- Each paper will have a summary at top, answering those questions.
- Each section will have an overview page, including:
    - The overall problem being solved
    - An overview of the history of the field, commenting on what papers had the most impact, and how ideas developed over time
    - Is there a general consensus on what methods work best for the problem in different scenarios?

To find papers to read, the strategy is:
- Are there any popular open source software libraries worth understanding?
- Find review papers and see what papers they highlight
- If a paper assumes knowledge from a particular citation, read this (but need to be quite selective, can't read every citation)

When I create pages for papers that cite each other, include these links at the top of the page too.
