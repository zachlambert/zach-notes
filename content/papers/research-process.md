Most advancements in robotics come from research papers, so it's worth knowing:

- The general process for how research gets published
- How to approach finding important research papers in robotics

## The academic research process

### Types of paper

A **research paper** is a piece of original research produced by a researcher.

A **review paper** is a publication that seeks to summarise the current state of a given research field.

### Where are papers published?

Anyone can produce a paper, but in order for it to be _official_, it must be published by some organisation. This includes:

- **Academic Journals**:
  - Published at regular intervals
  - For each edition, accepts submissions from researchers
  - Also known as: scientific journal, scholarly journal
- **Conferences**:
  - Conferences are in-person events where researchers can present their work
  - Like journals, conferences accept paper submissions from researchers, but this also involve the researcher giving a presentation on their work

Papers published to a journal/conference are called an **journal paper** or a **conference paper** respectively. This can include research or review papers.

Conferences and journals are free to accept papers as they wish but generally:

- They are specific to a given area of research (eg: robotics)
- They accept papers that are original and impactful, as well as of course high-quality
- There may also be a set of "hot topics" they give preferential treatment too, since these are the areas they deem as having the most impact

By imposing a high standard of quality on accepted papers, this gives credibility to journals/conferences and means that if your paper gets accepted, it is a mark of quality.

Which is better to submit to?

- This heavily depends on industry. For some, journals are more reputable, for others conferences are more reputable.
- In engineering/comp-sci, conferences tend to be more reputable and difficult to be accepted for

Note: Will see the acronym **CFP** = "Call for papers" which is the period over which a journal/conference is open for paper submissions.

### Submission process

You can only submit a paper to one journal or conference, unless it gets rejected in which case it can be submittied to another.

There are some exceptions, such as if you submit a paper to a conference, you may submit a follow-up paper to a journal if it expands significantly.

In order for a paper to get accepted:

- It must satisfy basic submission criteria
- The editor-in-chief does an initial appraisal to determine if it is worth consideration
- The journal/conference requests review from a set of academics they select who may accept/reject this invitation
- Once the reviewers are selected, each produce a detailed review and give a _recommendation_: accept, revise or reject
- The journal/conference evalutes the reviews and makes a decision
- If the paper needs revision, the researcher gets the feedback and re-submits
- If it gets rejected, the researcher gets feedback still, but may not re-submit to the same journal/conference

### PhD theses

A PhD thesis is submitted to the university. A PhD may produce a number of papers throughout their dissertation, but the thesis itself isn't published (I don't think?)

## Top conferences and journals for robotics

For robotics, conferences seem more reputable than journals.

Top Conferences:

- [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra): IEEE international conference on robotics and automation
- [IROS](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/financially-co-sponsored/iros): IEEE international conference on intelligent robotics and systems
- [RSS](https://roboticsconference.org/): Robotics science and systems
- [CASE](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/case): IEEE international conference on automation science and engineering

Journals:

- [Science Robotics](https://www.science.org/journal/scirobotics)

## How to know what papers are worth reading?

The best method is to read review papers.

Another reasonable metric is the _citation count_, can see this in [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) for example. (although this is only a general measure of influence, biased against papers for more niche topics, depends heavily on industry)

Generally papers are behind a paywall for the particular conference/journal (annoyingly!), but there are several ways to get around this:

- Sometimes the paper will have open access
- Google scholar will link the PDF on the right if available
- Usually the paper is on [arxiv](arxiv.org) which is an open-source distribution of papers
- If the paper isn't on arxiv, can often put the title into google with `ext:pdf` at the end. If the paper has been uploaded anywhere online by someone with access, google has likely indexed it and it will show up.
- Otherwise, can probably email the author and ask for the paper

For the IEEE conferences (IROS, ICRA, CASE) you can find these on ieexplore, ([eg: for IROS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000393/all-proceedings)) but need to pay for a membership.
