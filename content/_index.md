My objective with this website is to collect my personal notes in one place, such that:
- It helps me organise them and keep track of things.
- It provides a good reference for myself in the future, as well as for anyone else who could find it useful.

The code for the website is publicly available [here](https://github.com/zachlambert/zach-notes).

Since it's an active document, I will often create pages that are incomplete or placeholders. The status of each page will be displayed in the contents and it's title. The following label are used:
- STUB: Placeholder page with very little content, if any.
- WIP (Work-in-progress): Have done some work on this page, but needs more work.
- DRAFT: Mostly done, but rough and may need further review.
- DONE: No more work needed, but may make further changes in the future if I want.

## Maths

For maths concepts, I find it is hard to find good online resources, which are often too basic or lacking in detail. On the other hand, textbooks are generally very good, but take a lot of effort to get to the points you care about.

&nbsp;

I take more of an "_engineering maths_" approach, where I focus on the key results I care about and what is needed for programming, without exploring the concept in its full depth.

&nbsp;

However, I am primarily writing these notes for myself - so won't explain all prerequisite concepts and a fair amount of existing maths knowledge will be assumed.

## More about me

I'm currently working as a robotics software engineer, focused on mobile robotics in particular, and have experience with developing the core robotics algorithms as well as actually getting these to work on real hardware and managing the overall system.

&nbsp;

I studied Computer and Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where I focused on robotics modules and joined the robotics team as the primary software engineer. Since then I have continued to research and learn in my own time alongside my career.
