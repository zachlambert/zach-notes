My objective with this website is to collect my personal notes in one place, such that:
- It helps me organise them and keep track of things.
- It provides a good reference for myself in the future, as well as for anyone else who could find it useful.

## Maths

For maths concepts, I find it is hard to find good online resources, which are often too basic or lacking in detail. On the other hand, textbooks are generally very good, but take a lot of effort to get to the points you care about.

&nbsp;

I take more of an "_engineering maths_" approach, where I focus on the key results I care about and what is needed for programming, without exploring the concept in its full depth.

&nbsp;

However, I am primarily writing these notes for myself - so won't explain all prerequisite concepts (eg: vectors), so some level of existing maths knowledge will be required.

## More about me

I'm currently working as a robotics software engineer, focused on mobile robotics in particular, and have experience with developing the core robotics algorithms as well as actually getting these to work on real hardware and managing the overall system.

&nbsp;

I studied Computer and Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where I focused on robotics modules and joined the robotics team as the primary software engineer. Since then I have continued to research and learn in my own time alongside my career.
